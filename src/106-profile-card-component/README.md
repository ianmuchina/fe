## My process

I am not the pro version, so I recreated the site design from scratch. I used
[lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) as it's free and works on linux. After that
, coding it is easier since you aren't eyeballing as much.

For the css I used tailwind as it makes prototyping faster.

### Built with

- [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) - Cross-platform native design app.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### Continued development
